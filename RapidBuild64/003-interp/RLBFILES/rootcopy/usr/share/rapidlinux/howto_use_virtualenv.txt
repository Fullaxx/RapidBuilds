For virtualenv first make an environment:

# virtualenv <path_to_folder>

Then activate the environment:

# source <path_to_folder>/bin/activate

Now all your pip installs will be localized to that folder (not /usr/lib64/pthon2.7/site-packages)
You can easily turn that <path_to_folder> folder into an xzm with the full path.
