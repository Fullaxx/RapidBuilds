-# In a special case, we will handle the removal of the US/Pacific-New
-# timezone. A bit of background information on this:
-#
-# "US/Pacific-New' stands for 'Pacific Presidential Election Time',
-# which was passed by the House in April 1989 but never signed into law.
-# In presidential election years, this rule would have delayed the
-# PDT-to-PST switchover until after the election, to lessen the effect
-# of broadcast news election projections on last-minute west-coast
-# voters. "
-#
-# In nearly all cases, a machine that uses the US/Pacific-New timezone
-# has chosen it by mistake. In 2016, having this as the system timezone
-# actually led to clock errors, and after that it was decided that the
-# timezone (only of historical interest anyway) should be removed from
-# the timezone database.
-#
-# If we see that the machine's localtime-copied-from symlink is pointing
-# to US/Pacific-New, change it to point to US/Pacific instead.
