The GDK Broadway backend provides support for displaying GTK+ applications in a web browser, using HTML5 and web sockets.
To run your application in this way, select the Broadway backend by setting GDK_BACKEND=broadway.
Then you can make your application appear in a web browser by pointing it at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
Note that you need to enable web sockets in your web browser.
You can choose a different port from the default 8080
by setting the BROADWAY_DISPLAY environment variable to the port that you want to use.
It is also possible to use multiple GTK+ applications in the same web browser window,
by using the Broadway server, broadwayd, that ships with GTK+. To use broadwayd, start it like this:

broadwayd :5

Then point your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8084. Start your applications like this:

BROADWAY_DISPLAY=:5 gtk3-demo

BROADWAY_DISPLAY.  Specifies the Broadway display number. The default display is 1.
The display number determines the port to use when connecting to a Broadway application via the following formula:

port = 8080 + (display - 1)
